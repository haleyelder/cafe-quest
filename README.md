## Cafe Quest

React Leaflet project outlining coffee shops, restaurants, and etc places I want to visit around the Portland Metro area. 

Tidbits (project goals and future enhancements):
- main: react leaflet map
- left side of listings that are filterable by type and alpha, neighborhood 
- custom icons per location (dessert, coffee, restaurant)
- mobile styling
- clicking the location on the list will highlight on the map
