React Leaflet project highlighting coffee shops, restaurants, and dessert spots I've been recommended, or want to visit, around the Portland Metro area.


Tidbits ::
- Main: React Leaflet map with custom icons per restaurant type
- Full listing of places to the left that can be sorted by type, alpha (asc/desc), and neighborhood

Enhancements, etc ::
- [x] tweak custom icons per location a bit more (dessert, coffee, restaurant)
- [ ] clicking the location on the list will highlight on the map (vice versa?)

- [ ] refactor locations/state usage (repetitive)
- [ ] incorporate util functions file?
- [ ] refactor/add back in copy location name to paste

- [ ] restyle header, font pick or graphics
- [ ] mobile responsive styling
