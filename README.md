## Cafe Quest

React Leaflet project outlining coffee shops, restaurants, and etc places I want to visit around the Portland Metro area. 

Tidbits ::
- main: react leaflet map
- left side of listings that are filterable by type and alpha, neighborhood 

Enhancements, etc ::
- [ ] tweak custom icons per location a bit more (dessert, coffee, restaurant)
- [ ] clicking the location on the list will highlight on the map (vice versa?)

- [ ] refactor locations/state usage (repetitive)
- [ ] incorporate util functions file?
- [ ] refactor/add back in copy location name to paste

- [ ] restyle header, font pick or graphics  
- [ ] mobile responsive styling
